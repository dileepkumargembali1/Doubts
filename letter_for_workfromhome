Subject: Reminder: Planned Leave for [Festival Name]

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you are doing well. This is a gentle reminder about my planned leave from [start date] to [end date], which I had applied for earlier to celebrate [festival name] and travel home.

I will ensure all my tasks are completed or handed over before my leave to avoid any disruptions during my absence. Please feel free to let me know if there’s anything else you need me to address.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
