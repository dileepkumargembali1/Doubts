Subject: Request for Band Appraisal Consideration

Dear Rachit,

I hope you’re doing well.

I am reaching out to kindly request your consideration for my appraisal band to be A or B. This is important for me as I need to qualify for an upgrade exam, which requires at least a B band. This exam is a significant step in my professional development, and I would sincerely appreciate your support in this regard.

Please let me know if there’s anything I need to improve or any steps I should take to meet the criteria. Looking forward to your guidance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
